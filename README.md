# Classification-and-Clustering-Algorithms
Data Mining and Bioinformatics Course Projects

1. A classification model based on Nearest neighbor to classify gene datasets with 10-fold cross validation. Evaluated the model by Accuracy, Precision, Recall, f-measure.
2. A clustering model based on Hierarchical Agglomerative clustering to find cluster of genes which exhibit similar expressions. Evaluated the model by jaccard coefficient.
